<h1>
Correlation Between the Video and the Syllabus
</h1>
<p1>
Both the video and the syllabus talk about very similar things. They are both useful for giving insight to what the class and the real world is like. With the use of the video we see the real world application of some of the ideas presented in the syllabus. The video and the syllabus are useful tools to help students get prepared for some of what they are getting ready to do.

Correlation Between the Essay and the Syllabus

In the video, she discusses collaboration and working well with others. The syllabus discusses the idea as well. Even though most people think that software engineers work alone, it is quite the contrary. Often times they work together to share ideas and more. Because of this they need to make sure that they have good "soft skills". These skills are the way to communicate with other people that are around the person.

<h3>
Suggestions for the Syllabus
</h3>
<p3>
In the syllabus, there isn't much that there is to complain about. One thing I do wish is that I could see what is going to happen in the syllabus a little more. Also, a slight introduction to the class would also be appreciated, so that I could know what to expect.
